  abstract = {The authorities in a number of advanced countries have produced intergenerational reports that seek to determine the fiscal sustainability of current policy parameters. The Australian government will publish its intergenerational Report in May 2002. This paper attempts to place these reports in analytical perspective. We examine the notion of intergenerational equity, the conceptual basis for generational accounting, Australian efforts at constructing generational accounts, and then review the intergenerational reports of several other countries. The paper concludes with a brief synoptic discussion of various policies that can help Australian governments achieve intergenerational balance in future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

  abstract = {Property prices across many OECD countries have witnessed remarkable increases over the past 10 years. Two factors frequently posited for this boom are higher income levels and the benign interest rate environment experienced in many of these countries. However, empirical models of house prices struggle to achieve credible results concerning the impact of interest rates with coefficients that are frequently insignificant or of the wrong sign. In this paper we propose an intuitive theoretical model of house prices where the demand for housing is driven by how much individuals can borrow from financial institutions. This level of borrowing depends on disposable income levels and current interest rates. We empirically test this model by applying it to the Irish property market. Our results support the existence of a long-run relationship between actual house prices and the amount individuals can borrow with plausible and statistically significant adjustment to this long run equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Literary sources regarding public-private partnerships (PPPs) often mention the importance of conducting a value for money (VfM) analysis to determine the value of pursuing a project through a PPP versus a traditional procurement; however, few sources detail how agencies actually use this analysis in practice. This article provides a state-of-the-practice review of VfM analysis using examples from Australia, Canada, Europe, Africa, and Asia, focusing particularly on the VfM model used by agencies such as Partnerships Victoria, The United Kingdom's Her Majesty Treasury Department, and Partnerships British Columbia. Despite its growing applications in PPP projects from all different sectors, VfM has faced significant criticisms from academics and practitioners. This article evaluates reviews of VfM, noting the weaknesses and strengths of the methodology. Using the information derived from the evaluation, this article provides a guided reference for public agencies looking to adopt this VfM methodology in their current PPP decision-making framework.
