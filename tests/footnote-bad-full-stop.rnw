\Vref{fig:value-projects-by-project-stage} compares the Investment Monitor and Grattan datasets' estimates of the total value of the projects included in the Grattan dataset. Although the Grattan dataset only covers a limited number of projects, the high level of similarity between the value of the Investment Monitor and Grattan datasets' portfolios at each project stage provides assurance that the Investment monitor dataset is unbiased. The comparability of the Grattan and Deloitte datasets also holds at the individual project level, as there is no statistically significant difference between the average cost change on individual projects observed across the Grattan and Investment Monitor datasets\footnote{The t-distribution critical statistic of the difference between the two means is 0.35, far lower than the threshold of 1.68 required for statistical significance at the 90 per cent level of confidence with a sample of this size.}.
