The findings of these small studies present a mixed view.
Two key studies in 2007 and 2008 of infrastructure projects valued at more than \$20~million found overruns ranging from 12 to 35 per cent from formal funding commitment to completion\footnote{; Allen Consulting Group, Duffield, C. and Raisbeck, P. (2007) \emph{Performance of PPPs and traditional procurement in Australia}, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, p5.}and 24 to 52 per cent\footnote{Duffield, C., Raisbeck, P. and Xu, M. (2008) \emph{Report on the performance of PPP projects in Australia when compared with a representative sample of traditionally procured infrastructure projects}, p15.
Costs over the full project life mean originally announced to actual final costs.} over the full project life.
Another study of 58 projects found an average 12 per cent overrun.%
\footnote{Love (2012).} A further study of 46 projects found overruns of 5 to 11 per cent of project costs.%

While not seeking to be representative, an investigation by the Victorian Auditor General found a 5 per cent cost overrun across seven road and rail projects valued at more than \$40~million.%

\Vref{fig:value-projects-by-project-stage} compares the Investment Monitor and Grattan datasets' estimates of the total value of the projects included in the Grattan dataset. Although the Grattan dataset only covers a limited number of projects, the high level of similarity between the value of the Investment Monitor and Grattan datasets' portfolios at each project stage provides assurance that the Investment monitor dataset is unbiased. The comparability of the Grattan and Deloitte datasets also holds at the individual project level, as there is no statistically significant difference between the average cost change on individual projects observed across the Grattan and Investment Monitor datasets\footnote{The t-distribution critical statistic of the difference between the two means is 0.35, far lower than the threshold of 1.68 required for statistical significance at the 90 per cent level of confidence with a sample of this size.}.
