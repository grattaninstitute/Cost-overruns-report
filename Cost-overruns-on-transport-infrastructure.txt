Recommendation 6: Compile Australian database of completed projects

The Commonwealth should seek cooperation from the states to create
new benchmarking data to improve risk measurement in new project
proposals and public accountability. They should do so using data
collected through mechanisms described in Recommendation 3.

Recommendation 7: Hold the project contingency in a portfolio pool

Central agencies should hold project contingency funds at arm’s length
from project management, and formalise the conditions governing con-
tingency drawdown, to improve the cost-efficiency of risk management.

the 15 per cent reported across the four largest studies completed by
auditors of road projects.17

Other studies emphasise the importance of not assuming that Flyvb-
jerg’s international studies are representative of each of the countries
included in the sample. For instance, a study of the Dutch projects in
the Flyvbjerg sample shows an average cost overrun of 16.5 per cent.18
Many other studies have demonstrated variations in the size of overruns
across different countries.19

When cost overruns around the world are compared from the time of the
formal funding commitment or contract, Australia generally ranks in, or
slightly worse than, the mid range. Most studies of cost overruns focus
on contract compliance and engineering, which are most relevant from
the time of the contract, rather than the time a government or would-be
government first announces the project. Our public finance perspective
takes the starting point of a project as the initial cost announcement, as
this is the point at which a government becomes de facto committed.

The following chapter shows that premature announcement is in fact the
key underlying cause of ongoing cost overruns.

project typically increase by a further 26 per cent (see Figure 2.2 on the

Figure 2.2 shows that projects announced early tend to perform worse
than average against their cost estimates, not only in the early stages but
also later in the project’s life. This suggests that overly optimistic initial
cost estimates are rarely adequately adjusted straight away – reliable
project cost estimates may only eventuate half way through construction.

2.3   There is no accountability for poorly founded cost promises

There is at present no systematic public reporting on the effectiveness
of government spending on infrastructure projects. In particular, there is
no public reporting on how well government-funded transport infrastruc-
ture projects perform against the costs and benefits, such as travel time
savings, used to make the investment decision. This is a serious gap.

Infrastructure Australia, according to the law that establishes it, is sup-
posed to evaluate whether projects met targets set before or during

  Recommendation 3: Publish post-completion data
  To enable learning from past experience, and to improve
  accountability:

   a) The Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure should be
      required to publish to data.gov.au the post-completion report it
      already requires from state governments as a condition of
      providing final milestone payments for transport infrastructure
      projects. Reports should detail any scope changes and their
      justification, agreed and actual construction start and finish
      dates, actual project costs, reasons for overruns or under-runs,
      and progress against performance indicators.

   b) Infrastructure Australia should be asked to provide the Joint
      Committee of Public Accounts and Audit with a post-completion
      appraisal of the benefits and costs of each infrastructure
      project with Commonwealth funding of $50 million or more.

   c) The Council of Australian Governments should add a new
      category of infrastructure services to the terms of reference for
      the annual Report on Government Services, produced by the
      Productivity Commission.

Close to two thirds of cost overruns occur before construction begins.
When overruns occur during these early stages, there is an opportunity         15
for projects’ merits to be actively reappraised, in order to determine
whether projects still appear to be good investments (Figure 3.1).                                              6                                       24

$28 billion is problematic because it has caused substantial distortions
to investment planning processes. These distortions take three forms.

First, cost overruns distort decisions regarding how much to invest in
transport infrastructure relative to other spending priorities, such as
hospitals, schools and pensions. Transport infrastructure projects
have been systematically represented as if they were more attractive
and better value for money than they really are. At the portfolio level,

identify these projects, as 63 per cent of cost overruns occur before
construction begins, and 38 per cent before a formal budget commitment.
However, such active reappraisals do not appear to be happening
enough.                                                                               50

Over the last 15 years, two thirds of all announced projects have been
completed. Even those announced before a formal government funding
commitment are usually completed (Figure 3.2).                                        25

This cancellation rate seems lower than it should be. One indication
that it is too low is that this cancellation rate is less than the proportion

A second indication that the cancellation rate is too low is that many
projects with low net benefits are not being cancelled. Over the last
15 years, projects that incurred cost overruns were just as likely to be
cancelled as those that did not. This either means that the project
appraisal process is not being used to cancel the projects with invest-
ment merits that have been eroded by cost overruns, or that cancelled

The previous chapter highlighted the costs to the community of cost                    Figure 4.1: Experts systematically underestimate the likelihood of cost

on any given project is uncertain, on average cost estimates should                    Assumed and observed probability distributions of cost overruns, per cent
correspond to reality.                                                                 100

But there is a substantial gap between estimated and actual costs on
transport infrastructure projects over the past 15 years. In that period,               75
cost estimators expected between 10 and 25 per cent of projects to
exceed their budget. In fact, 34 per cent did so (Figure 4.1). Moreover,
these overruns were not offset by underruns.35
                                                                                        50
Although it is not possible to perfectly predict the costs of any individual
project, where cost estimates are wrong on average, there is clearly
scope to improve.                                                                       25

This chapter identifies three concrete opportunities to improve cost
estimation. First, cost estimates should reflect predictable patterns

For example, large36 road projects are more likely to come in over the
cost initially announced than they are to finish on budget. Being a
large road is not a subtle characteristic that could easily go unnoticed.

Ultimately all cost estimates use some combination of four tools: ex-
pected value, sensitivity analysis, probability pricing, and reference
class forecasting (see Box 7 on page 33). The various guidance docu-
ments present the same basic tools in a wide variety of ways. They are                         25
inconsistent in which of the main tools they recommend and in how they
guide the user through the relationships among the various tools (see

Cost overruns in transport infrastructure



6     Conclusion
Taxpayers have paid $28 billion more on transport infrastructure in the
past 15 years than they were told they would pay. This is 24 per cent
above the promised cost.

Premature announcements are the main causes of these cost overruns.
Projects that are announced prematurely more often cost overruns
and larger overruns than those announced at a more mature stage
of development. This is true not just in the run-up to a formal cost
assessment but throughout the project lifecycle. Limiting premature
announcements could substantially reduce cost overruns.

If premature announcements were reduced or eliminated, further over-
runs could be addressed through more comprehensive risk measure-
ment. More accurate cost estimates would give governments realistic
information that they could use to establish the size of the infrastructure
building program and the priorities within it.

They cannot do this until they collect information on past projects. Cost
estimation and risk management must allow for unforeseen as well as
known risks, and the best way to prepare for unforeseen events is to
learn from history. It is essential to collect and publish Australian data
on historical project outcomes, to allow better risk measurement and
account to the public for decisions made.

There are no grounds for believing that the problem has been fixed. On
the contrary, projects currently in the planning and delivery stages have
cost estimates that do not take account of the experience of the past 15
years, and many may well be at risk of significant cost overruns.

With actual Australian data on past projects, we would no longer need to
be surprised by what is predictable. Instead, our infrastructure systems
could promise what is worth having, and then deliver what is promised.

A.2   Risk measurement

Australia’s guidance on risk minimisation is generally of a high standard.
                                                                                   20
However, this guidance is not sufficient, as it is inevitable that some
cost risks will be impossible, or prohibitively expensive, to eliminate.
These remaining risks need to be accurately measured, so that they
can be factored into investment decisions and efficiently managed
throughout a project’s life.
                                                                                         Underrun          1     Overrun

Cost overruns in transport infrastructure


It should be noted that in the absence of such protocol, there are clear
incentives for contingencies to be managed at the project level. This
is because changes to project budgets that involve state treasuries in-
creasing projects’ budget allocations are open to more public scrutiny.
Consequently, project management teams are subject to lower repu-
tational risk when contingency funds are included within initial budget
allocations and managed at the project level.

Section 5.2.2 identified that contingency funds can be three times more
cost effective when managed at the portfolio level. For this reason, it
would be desirable for all states to adopt a stringent practice of managing
contingency funds at the portfolio.

The Investment Monitor dataset contains a number of extreme observa-
tions. The quality of these observations is difficult to ascertain because
not all of the sources underpinning the Investment Monitor dataset are
still accessible, and the search cost associated with finding the sources
for these data points is high. For this reason, we take a conservative
approach and exclude the 56 projects with overruns that are greater than

76. The t-distribution critical statistic of the difference between the two means is 0.35,
    far lower than the threshold of 1.68 required for statistical significance at the 90 per
    cent level of confidence with a sample of this size.

budget estimates are P75 costs. To allow for this variation in practices,                   P50   59 per cent                                                                   0 per cent

to be P75 costs should, on average, be P66 costs.                                          50 per cent of observations, for example.

To identify the estimated probability prices for different levels of risk                  The final column of Table B.1 reports the the difference, as percentage
tolerance, we assumed that all probability price estimates are biased by                   of budget commitment project costs, between the P50 and other esti-
the same amount, in the same direction.81                                                  mated probability prices. These figures have been calculated as the
                                                                                           difference between the 90th and 50th quantiles of the observed distri-
81. This is the most forgiving assumption that could be invoked regarding the average      bution of final costs over budgeted costs, using the median-unbiased
    distance between each probability price under the current estimation methodology,      estimator of sample quantiles.82
    as it is equivalent to assuming that the estimated probability prices were based off
    a probability distribution which takes the exact shape of the observed data            We draw two conclusions from this analysis. The first conclusion is that

    symmetric distributions, which would cause the error in estimated probability

    that probability price estimates have been based off a correctly shaped probability    after a budget commitment has been made is 21 per cent, and under the
    distribution, we only claim probability prices are downwardly biased by the lower
    bound of the of bias implied by the cost estimation guidelines.                        82. Hyndman and Fan, 1996

current probability price estimation methodology, a 21 per cent cost uplift
is equivalent to a P87 cost estimate.

Building off this finding, we also conclude that the average difference
between P50 and P90 cost estimates as a percentage of budgeted
project costs is approximately 21 per cent, under the current probability
price estimation methodology. This is because, as budgeted cost
estimates could also be interpreted as P50 cost estimates,83 the 21 per
cent cost uplift required to convert a budget commitment cost estimate
to a P90 cost estimate is also the appropriate uplift rate for converting a
P50 cost estimate to a P90 cost estimate.

The uplift required to convert a P50 cost estimate to a P90 cost estimate
may actually be far higher than this. Under an accurate probability
pricing methodology, this difference could actually be as large as 69 per
cent. We refrain from making this claim so as to only interpret observed
outcomes in relation to the probability price estimates that prevailed
when the cost outcomes were generated. This is because switching
to an accurate probability price estimation methodology could change
cost behaviour.




83. 34 per cent of projects finish above their budget commitment costs, but 91 per cent
    of projects finish on or above their budget commitment costs. This means that
    P9-P66 cost estimates should all be set equal to budget commitment costs.
